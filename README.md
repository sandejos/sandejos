- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Sanders and I am known in the crypto space as Colonel Crypto. I have taken an interest in quite a few different things over the years and they have all lead me
to be employeed at Gas Station Crypto and working with Promineo Tech learning how to do front end web development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code from the beginning I literally started two weeks ago but I cant wait to look back and see how far I have come. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any crpyto project on the front end, however; as soon as I learn front end web development I will beginning learning back end/ and solidity
